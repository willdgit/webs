An interactive experiment with Verlet Integration.

Uses the velocity Verlet algoritim to calculte the trajectory of particles and their constraints, allowing the user to modifiy simulation paramaters.
Modifying the opacity based on the range between points (multiplied by a coefficent) results in the graident-like effect seen in the constraints.
