An interactive experiment with Verlet Integration.

Uses the velocity Verlet algoritim to calculte the trajectory of particles and their constraints, allowing the user to modifiy simulation paramaters.
The range between points subtracted from a coefficent allows for the graident-like opacity effect seen in the constraints.
